You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

## Code Snippets
Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets with syntax highlighting and line numbering. It's pretty cool, check it out:

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
    val = 5
    puts "Hi there, #{name}"
    val += 8
    # "a long line that will not fit in here. It is really really long."
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll's GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll's dedicated Help repository][jekyll-help].

## LaTeX Typesetting
This even has support for $\LaTeX$[^1] typesetting if needed. It's a bit slow, but if you need mathematical formulas, this is the way to go. Here's the Shr√∂dinger Equation for a wave function $\varphi(\vec{r},t)$:

$$ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \;\nabla^2_{\vec{r}}\;\varphi(\vec{r},t) = \mathrm{i}\hbar\;\partial_t\;\varphi(\vec{r},t) $$
