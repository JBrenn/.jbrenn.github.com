December 11th is the deadline to reaching a new international climate agreement. We are on the [Road to Paris Climate 2015](http://www.cop21.gouv.fr/en), though we know no big steps will be climed after, we are on this road.

1. [China has been burning 17 percent more coal a year than the goverment previously disclosed.](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/04/world/asia/china-burns-much-more-coal-than-reported-complicating-climate-talks.html?hp=&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=first-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news).

Are we really on the road... Since the year 2000 Indonesia’s palm oil production has
4. Scientific understanding. [Are extreme effents cause by climate change](https://www2.ametsoc.org/ams/index.cfm/publications/bulletin-of-the-american-meteorological-society-bams/explaining-extreme-events-from-a-climate-perspective/) [Tree-ring reconstructions: Understanding past droughts](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/350/6261/646.5.full)
